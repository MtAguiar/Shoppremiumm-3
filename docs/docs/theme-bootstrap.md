title: Theme Bootstrap Process
---

When using `Nx-Shopify`, the theme's CSS styles and JavaScript scripts are loaded automatically for you. You do not need to move a finger. However, is still important to understand how this process is done in case of needed modifications.

:::tip

If you want to follow this explanation step-by-step, it is recommended to generate a theme so you can read the code by your self ðŸ™‚

`nx g @trafilea/nx-shopify:theme my-theme`

:::

## The main.ts file

The `main.ts` file is the, well, main entrypoint of a `Nx-Shopify` theme. This is the very first code that is executed when a theme is loaded by a web browser.

For a recently generated theme, the `main.ts` content should look something similar to this:

```typescript title="src/main.ts"
__webpack_public_path__ = window['__webpack_public_path__'];

import { themeBootstrapFactory } from '@my-org/my-theme/core/theme-bootstrap';
import { themeLayouts } from '@my-org/my-theme/theme/layout';
import { themeTemplates } from '@my-org/my-theme/theme/templates';

window['themeBootstrap'] = themeBootstrapFactory(themeLayouts, themeTemplates);
```

This file fullfills two key responsabilities:

1. Make the webpack public path available to webpack.
2. Define the global themeBootstrap function that will load the rest of our code.

Let's break this down...

### Webpack public path

The top-level `__webpack_public_path__` variable is used to tell `webpack`, at run-time, what URL path it should look to download the rest of the chunks that will be loaded later (lazy loaded chunks).

As you may notice, this URL path comes from a window global variable called the same way. But, where does the value come from? The answer is that Nx-Shopify does this for you:

For every built theme, two special snippets are created:

```diff
dist/apps/my-theme
 â”œâ”€â”€ assets
 â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ (...)
 â”‚   â””â”€â”€ main.77d0b739d857080b2b1e.js
 â”œâ”€â”€ config
 â”‚   â””â”€â”€ (...)
 â”œâ”€â”€ config.yml
 â”œâ”€â”€ layout
 â”‚   â””â”€â”€ (...)
 â”œâ”€â”€ locales
 â”‚   â””â”€â”€ (...)
 â”œâ”€â”€ sections
 â”‚   â””â”€â”€ (...)
 â”œâ”€â”€ snippets
 â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ (...)
+â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ script-tags.liquid
+â”‚   â””â”€â”€ webpack-public-path.liquid
 â””â”€â”€ templates
     â””â”€â”€ (...)
```

#### `snippets/script-tags.liquid`

This snippet renders the `webpack-public-path` snippet content and also adds the script tag that loads the `main.ts` entrypoint generated by webpack.

```html
{% render 'webpack-public-path' %}

<script
  type="text/javascript"
  src="{{ 'main.77d0b739d857080b2b1e.js' | asset_url }}"
  defer="defer"
></script>
```

#### `snippets/webpack-public-path.liquid`

This particular snippet executes a liquid code in charge of getting the base path of the Shopify's CDN url where the assets are located and assign it to the `window.__webpack_public_path__` global variable.

```html
{% assign randomFile = 'randomFile.js' | asset_url %} {% assign cdnPath =
randomFile | split: 'assets/randomFile.js' | first %}
<script>
  window.__webpack_public_path__ = '{{ cdnPath }}';
</script>
```

Once the above runs, webpack knows where to download the rest of our code chunks.

### themeBootstrap function

As shown in the `main.ts` assignment, the `themeBootstrap` function is created using a factory function inside the `src/core` directory called `themeBootstrapFactory`.

The `themeBootstrapFactory` function is a [high order function](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/a-quick-intro-to-higher-order-functions-in-javascript-1a014f89c6b/) that receives the theme `registeredLayouts` and `registeredTemplates` as arguments and returns a function that takes a `ShopifyBootstrapOptions` object used to initialize the theme (which will be the `themeBootstrap` function).

You can write content using [GitHub-flavored Markdown syntax](https://github.github.com/gfm/).

## Markdown Syntax

To serve as an example page when styling markdown based Docusaurus sites.

## Headers

# H1 - Create the best documentation

## H2 - Create the best documentation

### H3 - Create the best documentation

#### H4 - Create the best documentation

##### H5 - Create the best documentation

###### H6 - Create the best documentation

## Emphasis

Emphasis, aka italics, with _asterisks_ or _underscores_.

Strong emphasis, aka bold, with **asterisks** or **underscores**.

Combined emphasis with **asterisks and _underscores_**.

Strikethrough uses two tildes. ~~Scratch this.~~

---

## Lists

1. First ordered list item
1. Another item
   - Unordered sub-list.
1. Actual numbers don't matter, just that it's a number
   1. Ordered sub-list
1. And another item.

- Unordered list can use asterisks

* Or minuses

- Or pluses

## Links

[I'm an inline-style link](https://www.google.com/)

[I'm an inline-style link with title](https://www.google.com/ "Google's Homepage")

[I'm a reference-style link][arbitrary case-insensitive reference text]

[You can use numbers for reference-style link definitions][1]

Or leave it empty and use the [link text itself].

URLs and URLs in angle brackets will automatically get turned into links. http://www.example.com/ or <http://www.example.com/> and sometimes example.com (but not on GitHub, for example).

Some text to show that the reference links can follow later.

[arbitrary case-insensitive reference text]: https://www.mozilla.org/
[1]: http://slashdot.org/
[link text itself]: http://www.reddit.com/

## Images

Here's our logo (hover to see the title text):

Reference-style: ![alt text][logo]

Images from any folder can be used by providing path to file. Path should be relative to markdown file.

## Code

```javascript
var s = 'JavaScript syntax highlighting';
alert(s);
```

```python
s = "Python syntax highlighting"
print(s)
```

```
No language indicated, so no syntax highlighting.
But let's throw in a <b>tag</b>.
```

```js {2}
function highlightMe() {
  console.log('This line can be highlighted!');
}
```

## Tables

Colons can be used to align columns.

| Tables        |      Are      |   Cool |
| ------------- | :-----------: | -----: |
| col 3 is      | right-aligned | \$1600 |
| col 2 is      |   centered    |   \$12 |
| zebra stripes |   are neat    |    \$1 |

There must be at least 3 dashes separating each header cell. The outer pipes (|) are optional, and you don't need to make the raw Markdown line up prettily. You can also use inline Markdown.

| Markdown | Less      | Pretty     |
| -------- | --------- | ---------- |
| _Still_  | `renders` | **nicely** |
| 1        | 2         | 3          |

## Blockquotes

> Blockquotes are very handy in email to emulate reply text. This line is part of the same quote.

Quote break.

> This is a very long line that will still be quoted properly when it wraps. Oh boy let's keep writing to make sure this is long enough to actually wrap for everyone. Oh, you can _put_ **Markdown** into a blockquote.

## Inline HTML

<dl>
  <dt>Definition list</dt>
  <dd>Is something people use sometimes.</dd>

  <dt>Markdown in HTML</dt>
  <dd>Does *not* work **very** well. Use HTML <em>tags</em>.</dd>
</dl>

---

## Line Breaks

Here's a line for us to start with.

This line is separated from the one above by two newlines, so it will be a _separate paragraph_.

This line is also a separate paragraph, but... This line is only separated by a single newline, so it's a separate line in the _same paragraph_.
